matplotlib==3.1.0 
libtiff
numpy==1.16.4
scipy==1.2.0
pandas==0.24.2
sympy==1.4
glob2
glob3
opencv-python==4.1.0.25

Training.ipynb includes the Python code for training the algorithm with U-Net architecture.

If you need to use the pre-trained weights, change the name of the .h5 (weights file) file to match the 
name of the weights file you have downloaded where ever required.
model_onehot.h5 contains the pre-trained weights.

Testing.ipynb includes the PythonCode for Testing, calculating accuracies, calculating confusion matrices for 
training and validation and saving predictions by the U-Net model on testing images.

You might get an error: xrange is not defined while running our code. This error is not due to errors in our code 
but due to not up to date python package named libtiff (some parts of the source code of the package are in python2 
and some are in python3) which we used to read the dataset which in which the images are in .tif format. We were 
not able to use other libraries like openCV or PIL to read the images as they are not properly supporting to 
read the 4-channel .tif images.

This error can be resolved by editing the source code of the libtiff library.

Replace and save the libtiff ctype file with the file in
